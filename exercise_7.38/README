# 7.38 Write a program that reads N points in a plane and outputs any group of four or more colinear points (i.e., points on the same line).
# The obvious brute-force algorithm requires O(N4) time. However, there is a better algorithm that makes use of sorting and runs in O(N^2 log N) time.
##

In order to find colinear points to a given point P, it is enough to find a set of points having the same degrees to P.

We start by choosing point P. Then we compute the degrees between P and every other point in the set.
Then we can sort the array of degrees with the time complexity of O(nlog(n)).
We can traverse the sorted array trying to find groups of 3 or more points with same angle degrees to P.

If we find any such a group, we can output it together with P as a group of colinear points.

We do it for every possible choice of P, until a group is found.
