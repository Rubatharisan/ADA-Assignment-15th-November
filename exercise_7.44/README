7.44 Suppose you have an array of N elements containing only two distinct keys, true and false.
Give an O(N) algorithm to rearrange the list so that all false elements precede the true elements.
You may use only constant extra space.

We will be using the Counting sort algorithm to solve our problem. We run through the array to count all the false elements.
At next, we are going to make all elements from index 0 to our false elements count to false, and the rest as true.

Our results:

###
# Our newly created boolean array
##
=> [true, true, true, false, false, false, false, false, true, false]

###
# Our sorted boolean array
##
=> [false, false, false, false, false, false, true, true, true, true]
