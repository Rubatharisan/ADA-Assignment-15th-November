7.53 We are given an array that contains N numbers. We want to determine if there are two numbers whose sum equals a given number K. For instance, if the input is 8, 4, 1, 6 and K is 10, then the answer is yes (4 and 6). A number may be used twice.

a. Give an O(N^2) algorithm to solve this problem.
    A nested for loop should suffice.

     ** Using a predefined array with values: [1, 0, 3, 9, 3, 5, 0, 7, 8]
     Initial array: [1, 0, 3, 9, 3, 5, 0, 7, 8]

     [Nested for-loop] We are looking for a pair that gives out the sum: 7

     Pair found: 0 + 7 = 7

b. Give an O(N log N) algorithm to solve this problem. (Hint: sort the items first. After that is done, you can solve the problem in linear time). 

    We will first sort the array with java's sort algorithm, hereafter compare array[start] with array[end].

    { We will decrement array[end] every time that the complementary of array[start] is not found, when hit is found }
